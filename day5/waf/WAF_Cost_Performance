Cost Optimization,Understand the cost implications of Availability Zones,https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/availability-zones/,Medium,Application Design,Design,50,"Availability Zones can be used to optimize application availability within a region by providing datacenter level fault tolerance. However, the application architecture must not share dependencies between zones to use them effectively. It is also important to note that Availability Zones may introduce performance and cost considerations for applications which are extremely 'chatty' across zones given the implied physical separation between each zone and inter-zone bandwidth charges. That also means that AZ can be considered to get higher Service Level Agreement (SLA) for lower cost. Be aware of  pricing changes coming to Availability Zone bandwidth starting February 2021.",N,
Cost Optimization,Set up a disaster recovery strategy that splits the application components and data into defined groups,https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/backup/guidance-best-practices,Medium,Application Design,Design,50,"Exclude disk  provides an efficient and cost-effective choice to selectively back up critical data.

LUNs are then presented to an initiator (VM) from a target (disk). These LUNs look like direct-attached-storage (DAS) or a local drive to the VM.",N,
Cost Optimization,Consider using reserved Premium disks,https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/disks-reserved-capacity,Medium,Capacity & Service Availability Planning,Efficiency,50,"Azure Disk Storage reservations are available only for select Azure premium SSD SKUs. The SKU of a premium SSD determines the disk's size and performance. A disk reservation is made per disk SKU. As a result, the reservation consumption is based on the unit of the disk SKUs instead of the provided size. Make sure you track the usage in disk SKUs instead of provisioned or used disk capacity.",N,
Cost Optimization,Consider spot VMs,https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/cost/optimize-vm#spot-vms,Medium,Capacity & Service Availability Planning,Efficiency,50,"Spot VMs are ideal for workloads that can be interrupted, such as highly parallel batch processing jobs.

Cost Optimization,Define a clear price model for individual services,https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/cost/design-price,Medium,Capacity & Service Availability Planning,Efficiency,50,As part of driving a good behavior it's important that the consumer has understood why they are paying the price for a service and also that the cost is transparent and fair to the user of the service or else it can drive wrong behavior.,N,
Cost Optimization,Develop a plan to modernize the workload,https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/architecture/serverless/,Low,Application Design,Design,10,"Is there a plan to change the execution model to Serverless? To move as far as you can up the stack towards cloud-native. When the workload is serverless, it's charged only for actual use, whereas with traditional infrastructure there are many underlying things that need to be factored into the price. By applying an end date to the application it encourages you to discuss the goal of re-designing the application to make even better use of the cloud. It might be more expensive from an Azure cost point of view but factoring in other things like licenses, people, time to deploy can drive down cost.",N,
Cost Optimization,Use developer SKUs for dev/test purposes,https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/dev-test/,Low,Deployment & Testing,Testing & Validation,10,"Special SKUs and subscription offers for development and testing purposes can save costs, but have to be used properly.

Cost Optimization,Consider VM Zone to Zone DR,https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-zone-to-zone-disaster-recovery,Low,Application Design,Design,10,Site Recovery does not move or store customer data out of the region in which it is deployed when the customer is using Zone to Zone Disaster Recovery.  Note that the egress charges that you would see in zone to zone disaster recovery would be lower than region to region disaster recovery.,N,
Cost Optimization,Be aware of cost implications of Web Application Firewall,https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/web-application-firewall/,Low,Networking & Connectivity,Endpoints,10,"There are cost implications to using Front Door with Web Application Firewall enabled, but it can save costs compared to using a 3rd party solution. Front Door has a good latency, because it uses unicast. If only 1 or 2 regions are required, Application Gateway can be used. There are cost implications of having a WAF - you should check pricing of hours and GB/s.",N,
Cost Optimization,Be aware of extra cost when tunnelling traffic through on-premises,https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/forced-tunneling,Low,Networking & Connectivity,Data flow,10,Consider the extra cost related to data ingress and egress if your application requires to use forced tunneling.,N,
Cost Optimization,Consider multi-tenant or microservices scenarios when running multiple applications,https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/microservice-applications/,Low,Capacity & Service Availability Planning,Efficiency,10,"When running multiple applications (typically in multi-tenant or microservices scenarios) density can be increased by deploying them on shared infrastructure and utilizing it more. For example: Containerization and moving to Kubernetes (Azure Kubernetes Services) enables pod-based deployment which can utilize underlying nodes efficiently.
